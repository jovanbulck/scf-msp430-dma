# SCF-MSP430
This repository contains a tool called Side-Channel Finder for MSP, a static analysis tool to automatically verify  binary files compiled for MSP430 microcontroller to detecting information leakage through novel interrupt-latency attacks (a.k.a. Nemesis), timing side-channels, and undesired information flow.

## Pre-requisites
- To run SCF-MSP, **Python 3** is required.<br/>
- For parsing and analyzing ELF files, a Python library, **pyelftools**, is required to install. See https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools for more details.
- The graph library **NetworkX 1.11**.

## Creating input files
SCF-MSP takes an input file in the JSON format. It contains the path to the binary file, the starting function, a list of starting functionâ€™s arguments from high-level code and return values.

We assume a function

    int func(int secret, int public)

in a binary file "A". The corresponding json file could be like:

  { <br/>
	"file": "A",<br/>
	"starting_function": "func",<br/>
	"timing_sensitive": true,
	
	"parameters": [{
	
			"size": 1,
			
			"confidential": true 
			
		}, {
		
			"size": 1,
			
		    "confidential": false
		    
		}
		
	],
	
	"memory": false,
	
	"result": {
	
		"size": 1,
		
		"confidential": true,
		
        "memory": false
	
	}
	
}

The security level of parameters can be set by **confidential** directive. Setting the confidential directive to true makes the parameter confidential.
